Julia is a language for scientitic computing that is high-level with syntax similar to Matlab and Python yet it runs as fast as C/C++ on several computational benchmarks. Julia has support for distributed computing and parallelization across cores and machines. Julia is still under development and undergoes changes in the language and debugging capability. However, it makes a promising platform for distributed implementation of Bayesian non-parametric algorithms.
